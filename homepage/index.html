    <h1>Dragon Project Revision + Reflection</h1>
    <p></p>Unfortunately, due to personal time constraints, I was unable to get far into the 
    work on the dragon project. While I have no excuse for this, I will still elaborate and reflect on 
    this semester.</p>
    <p>This class has taught me various things. Before this class, my knowledge of CSS, JS, and HTML was limited
    to accessing the inspect element function. However, as the semester wraps up, I realize how much I really 
    have learned. When it come to HTML before this semester, all I knew was how to edit the HTML in the inspect
    element tab. Now I know that the HTML is essentially the backbone of every page and is why it works how it 
    does for the most part. In respects to CSS, I learned what CSS was to start off. Before this class, I had only
    heard of CSS a few times so my knowledge was very, very limited. However, now I understand that CSS is the 
    "decorative feature" of websites. We also briefly touched on JS. While I don't completely understand it, it
    appears that it controls the moving features in a website. This is something I hadn't even known existed 
    prior to this class. While I knew Javascript existed, I had no idea that the potential using it extended this
    far.</p>
    <p>Overall, I enjoyed this class this semester. While I couldn't be attentive for some of the content, work, 
    and classes, the time I was available, I found myself constantly learning something new. I think in this class, 
    some things I did well were remembering what I learned, essentially retaining what was given to me. I say I did
     this well because this is a rare occurence for me in most cases. I tend to forget things quickly, but in this
      case, I actually remember what I learned. If I could do something over again, I would definitely allocate more
      of my time to this class. As a result of not having enough time, my grades will suffer in the end. However
      in the long run, what I learned will stay with me and I don't regret taking the course, no matter how my 
      grade is in the end. Thank you.</p>
      <h1>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h1>
      <p>Progressive enhancement is something that focuses on the content being put out instead of the
      browser you're using. This makes things easier for every browser available. Essentially you are starting
      with a base of a website and then building upon it. Think of it as a skeleton. You want this skeleton to
      be a soldier for war, so you add the organs, then the muscle, then then skin, then the clothes, then the
      armor. That is essentially how progressive enhancement works. You work outwards so every user can have a 
      better site experience.</p>
      <p>I think progressive enhancement is important because it provides everyone an equal site experience. It 
      also makes building a website easier and allows you to pass along a task to someone else if you don't know 
      how to do it. This makes the process much more fluid and fast. </p>
